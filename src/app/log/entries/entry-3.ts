  title: "Added Three.js Background Animation",
  content:
    "Implemented an interactive particle field behind the hero section using Three.js and @react-three/fiber. The animation includes 5,000 particles with mouse-tracking interactivity. Chose Three.js for its ease of integration with React via react-three/fiber, the control it offers over rendering and scene composition, and its relatively lightweight footprint compared to full 3D engines.",
